Master Thesis Project by Harshit Yadav

## Project Description
 In this project, we will compare two algorithms for stock prediction. First, we will utilize the Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network to do the Stock Market Prediction. LSTM is a powerful method that is capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. Furthermore, we will utilize Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to make the prediction. LSTM will be used as a generator, and CNN as a discriminator. In addition, Natural Language Processing(NLP) will also be used in this project to analyze the influence of News on stock prices.
